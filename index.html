                    <p class="text-muted text-left">The church claims its origin to the pre-independence days. Rev.Fr.John Damisien, the father of Neyyattinkara mission, founded in 1901, founded Kundamanbhagam Mission which was under control of the parish of Palayam. Further missionary work, by Rev.Fr.Gregory O.C.D and Rev.Fr.Pascasious O.C.D resulted in the beginning of the church's construction in 1904 at Kundamanbhagam. Missionaries of Carmelite belonging to the Asters Province in Belgium helped. Though the region was remote, the feast of St. Sebastian attracted believers. Furthermore, records reveal that Dr. Alosious Maria Benzigar, the Bishop of Quilon visited Kundamanbhagam mission and upon his suggestion the missionaries rebuilt the church of St. Francis Xavier at Peyad. It bears a combination of Greek and Roman architecture and has a Church Bell brought by Fr.Pascasious O.C.D from Belgium and it is one among the 44 Church Bells belonging to the same make. The Missionaries from Belgium selected an engineer from Belgium and native Kunju Contractor to complete the shrine. The present residence for the priest was built during the time of Fr. Brocard O.C.D. In those days St.Xavier Church at Peyad was known as a Partial district comprising Kundamanbhagam. As per Ora Malabaria the diocese of Thiruvananthapuram originated in 1937 July 1 with Rev.Fr.Vincent Dereire as the first Bishop of Thiruvananthapuram who established 15 High Schools, 28 Middle Schools and 68 Primary schools.</p>

                        HCP Group has a long history of providing honorary professional services St. Xavier’s High School, Loyola Hall, Ahmedabad.  The design brief was Interior Design for the new auditorium space “for varied types of performances” and one that can accommodate a large proportion of the 1,200 pupils.  Our key design aim was to ensure enough flexibility to accommodate a range of school activities and stage performances.  We also needed to make sure that the fixtures and fitting were durable enough to withstand expected wear and tear of a bustling school environment.  The lighting and sound systems were designed to allow for different configurations.  To optimize seating capacity we chose to use bench based seating, which also contributed to the informal ambiance.  Highly durable materials were preferred wherever necessary and rays of vibrant colors added to a sense of warmth and comfort. The outcome was an efficient and smart yet informal environment.  For HCPID it was also an exercise in exploring ways in which the scope for interior design and services can be stretched to accommodate communication or entertainment in built form.

Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike.

                Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                <br>
                <b>2. Economics</b>
                Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.
                <br>
               <b> 3. Productivity / Efficiency</b>
                Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
